## run-job üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

The easiest way to run a simple one-shot job on Kubernetes.

run-job üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è does the following with a simple YAML file definition:
* Creates a Kubernetes Job
* Watches until it passes or fails
* Collects its logs (if available)
* Deletes the job

It's primary usecase is for [checking OpenFaaS installations for customers](https://github.com/openfaas/config-checker) where it requires a service account to access various resources in a controlled way.

## Example 1 - a customer diagnostics tool with a service account

Create a `job.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: checker
image: ghcr.io/openfaas/config-checker:latest
namespace: openfaas
sa: openfaas-checker
```

Download run-job from [the releases page](https://github.com/alexellis/run-job/releases), or use arkade:

```bash
$ arkade get run-job
```

Then start the job defined in `job.yaml` and export the logs to a `report.txt` file:

```bash
$ run-job \
    -f job.yaml \
    -out report.txt
```

## Example 2 - light relief with ASCII cows

cows.yaml:

```yaml
$ cat <<EOF > cows.yaml
image: alexellis2/cows:latest
name: cows
EOF
```

Run the job:

```bash
$ run-job -f cows.yaml

        ()  ()
         ()()
         (oo)

Eh, What's up Doc?
```

## Why does this tool exist?

Running a Job in Kubernetes is confusing:

* The spec is very different to what we're used to building (Pods/Deployments)
* The API is harder to use to check if things worked since it uses conditions
* Getting the name of the Pod created by a job is a pain
* Getting the logs from a job is a pain, and needs multiple get/describe/logs commands

Inspired by:

* [alexellis/jaas](https://github.com/alexellis/jaas) built in 2017, now deprecated for running jobs on Docker Swarm 
* Also [stefanprodan/kjob](https://github.com/stefanprodan/kjob) by Stefan Prodan, now unmaintained for 3 years
