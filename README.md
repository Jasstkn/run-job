## run-job üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

The easiest way to run a simple one-shot job on Kubernetes.

run-job üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è does the following with a simple YAML file definition:
* Creates a Kubernetes Job
* Watches until it passes or fails
* Collects its logs (if available)
* Deletes the job

It's primary usecase is for [checking OpenFaaS installations for customers](https://github.com/openfaas/config-checker) where it requires a service account to access various resources in a controlled way.

## Example

Create a `job.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: checker
image: ghcr.io/openfaas/config-checker:latest
namespace: openfaas
sa: openfaas-checker
```

Run the job and export the logs to a report.txt file:

```bash
run-job \
    -f job.yaml \
    -out report.txt
```

## Why does this tool exist?

Running a Job in Kubernetes is confusing:

* The spec is very different to what we're used to building (Pods/Deployments)
* The API is harder to use to check if things worked since it uses conditions
* Getting the name of the Pod created by a job is a pain
* Getting the logs from a job is a pain, and needs multiple get/describe/logs commands

Inspired by:

* [alexellis/jaas](https://github.com/alexellis/jaas) built in 2017, now deprecated for running jobs on Docker Swarm 
* Also [stefanprodan/kjob](https://github.com/stefanprodan/kjob) by Stefan Prodan, now unmaintained for 3 years
